Unfortunately I did wait to the last minute and tried my best to get it done, but in the end here I am at 3:30am. Almost 4 hours past the due time. LOL

Anyways.
 - I was not able to get the 1 ticket GET request done.

 - Styling looks bland(that's because there is none), but I will definitely add to it before next phase.

 - The JSON data from the POST request overwrites the file when saved and I didn't have time to figure that one out.
